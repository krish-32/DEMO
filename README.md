Project Definition: The project involves deploying IoT sensors to measure noise pollution in public areas and providing real-time noise level data accessible to the public through a platform or mobile app. The primary objective is to raise awareness about noise pollution and enable informed decision-making. This project includes defining objectives, designing the IoT sensor system, developing the noise pollution information platform, and integrating them using IoT technology and Python.Noise pollution monitoring is the process of measuring and analyzing noise levels in an area to assess its impact, identify sources, and develop strategies for noise reduction and compliance with regulations
